A simple shopping list.

## Things you can do with it

- You can add predefined shopping lists (in HTML)
- You can add items to your list
- You can delete items from your list
- It works when you're offline

## Things you can't do with it

You can't sync. And you can't do everything else that's not in the previous section.

## Issues

Only works on touch devices, since it uses `touchstart` instead of `click` (only tested on my own iPhone)
Really just a hack project, you probably shouldn't use this as a basis for a professional app.
